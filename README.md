Welcome to my Budget Tracker!
NOTES - The transaction history & pie chart remain hidden until Income or Expense data is added to the budget.
Secondly, if you go over budget you will recieve a warning, Income and Expenses are displayed in green and red respectively.

Instructions:
To use, simply input the description of you transaction (paycheck/tax refund/groceries cost/etc.).
Next, input the amount said transaction was as a numerical value, no "$" is needed.
Then, click add to budget, and begin tracking what you earn/spend!
